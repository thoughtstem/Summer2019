# Game Katas

## Summary 

These step-by-step kata sets teach how to use the ___2htdp/universe___ library.

All katas in this folder aim to teach __game-like interaction__ alongside __animation__.

__Add your katas to examples.rkt! Please follow the already established formatting!__

### Kata Sets

The vision of the my-game project is to make programming fun by introducing new concepts each kata until the final kata in a kata set allows the student to build a finished, game-like product. __Feel free to make your own kata set!__

Below are the kata sets provided and already added to __examples.rkt__:
  - __plane-game__ (un-finished) provides katas to create a simple game in which a user-controlled plane shoots bullets.
  - __googly-eyes__ provides katas to create an interactive eye.
  - __shape-games__ consists of two separate sets that have to do with shape manipulation:
    - __art-games__ provides katas to create a drawing game using the mouse.
    - __rectangle-games__ teaches various, important animation concepts using rectangles for maximum simplicity.
